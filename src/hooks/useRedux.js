/**
 * A hook to access the redux store's state and to bind action creators to
 * the store's dispatch function. In essence, this hook is a combination of
 * `useSelector` and `useActions`.
 *
 * Note that this hook does currently not allow to pass a dependencies array,
 * so the passed selector and any created callbacks are not memoized. If you
 * require memoization, please use `useActions` and `useSelector`.
 *
 * @param {Function} selector the selector function
 * @param {Function|Function[]|Object.<string, Function>} actions the action creators to bind
 *
 * @returns {[any, any]} a tuple of the selected state and the bound action creators
 *
 * @example
 *
 * import React from 'react'
 * import { useRedux } from 'react-redux'
 * import { RootState } from './store'
 *
 * export const CounterComponent = () => {
 *   const [counter, { inc1, inc }] = useRedux(state => state.counter, {
 *     inc1: () => ({ type: 'inc1' }),
 *     inc: amount => ({ type: 'inc', amount }),
 *   })
 *
 *   return (
 *     <>
 *       <div>
 *         {counter}
 *       </div>
 *       <button onClick={inc1}>Increment by 1</button>
 *       <button onClick={() => inc(5)}>Increment by 5</button>
 *     </>
 *   )
 * }
