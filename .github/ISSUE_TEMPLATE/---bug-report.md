**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**

(If this is a _usage question_, please **do not post it here**—post it on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/redux) instead. If this is not a “feature” or a “bug”, or the phrase “How do I...?” applies, then it's probably a usage question.)


**What is the current behavior?**



**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) or RN Snack (https://snack.expo.io/) example below:**



**What is the expected behavior?**



**Which versions of React, ReactDOM/React Native, Redux, and React Redux are you using?  Which browser and OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React Redux?**
