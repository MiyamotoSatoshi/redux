**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**

(If this is a _usage question_, please **do not post it here**—post it on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/redux) instead. If this is not a “feature” or a “bug”, or the phrase “How do I...?” applies, then it's probably a usage question.)

**What is the current behavior?**

**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar.**

**What is the expected behavior?**

**Which versions of Redux, and which browser and OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of Redux?**
